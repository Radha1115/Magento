GitHub :

GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.

Pull all the latest changes made by your collaborators from the remote repository on GitHub.
Push back your own changes to the same remote repository on GitHub.

git init 
git clone url
git status
git add -A or git add 
git commit -m 'msg'
git push -u origin bname


git pull origin bname
git remote add origin url

if three developers are working on a project, they can create their own branches and work on them as the branches are isolated, so everyone can work in their branch.

A branch can be:

Local – only on your local machine.
Remote – it is on a remote location, for example in the GitHub repo.
