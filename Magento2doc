Magento 2 Dependency Injection
- A class depends on other classes.
- Dependency Injection is to inject the dependency into the class from another source.

	dependecy injection type 
		- Contructore injection : the commonly used ways to inject dependencies, add a parameter in the class constructor to inject the dependency. 
		- Method Injection :  Method injection can be used best when the dependency may vary on each method call. When an object requires performing specific actions on a dependency that cannot be injectable. For ex : observer.

	Dependency types/Dependency Injection Object Types
		- Injectable : Injectable objects in Magento 2 are classes that can be instantiated and managed by the Dependency Injection (DI) container. They are typically used for services, repositories, and other core functionalities.
		- Non-injectable. : those that cannot be automatically instantiated and managed by the DI container. These objects are typically instantiated using the new keyword directly in the code. Non-injectable objects may still have dependencies, but their instantiation is not controlled by the DI container.

	Other
		- Object manager : it creates hidden dependencies that are not required. it doesn’t follow the M2 Development Processes. The create () method of Object Manager can create your class’s objects, get, and pass the value for constructor parameter from di.xml files, we don’t recommend using it. 
		- Compiling dependencies  : Magento uses code compiler tools to collect all class dependency information and stores that information in files. The object manager uses that information during the class creating process to create concrete objects in the application.

		The compiler helps generate service classes that do not exist in the codebase (proxies, factories, and interceptors) but are declared in code or in a configuration.

Magento 2 Plugin
- allows for modifying the behavior of a public class or method.
- which you can execute some code before, after, and around the code/target class’s function
- plugin sortOrder. Plugins that call the same method run them using this order.
	3 methods in Plugin
	before - beforeDispatch()
	around - aroundDispatch()
	after - afterDispatch()
Limitations Of Plugin
	Final methods
	Final classes
	Non-public methods
	Class methods (such as static methods)
	__construct and __destruct
	Virtual types

Magento 2 Preference
- implement some interfaces or to rewrite/override the existing PHP classes and their methods. 
- you can extend a core class to rewrite the functions of that class; the new class is expected to be a complete implementation of the extended class

Magento 2 Event and Observer 
- Using events and observers, you can run your custom code in response to a specific event or even a custom event.
- execute the multiple numbers of observers for a single event trigger
Event : Events are dispatched by modules when certain actions are triggered
Observer : Observers are the particular classes that control the general behavior, performance, or change in the business logic of the store. They are executed whenever a specific event for which they were set to listen is triggered.

 Plugin vs Observer :
 - Observers can edit both private and protected methods, but plugins can only modify public methods.
 - Although there is a sort order for plugins, there is none for observers.
 - Only events that have already been delivered in Magento can be added to the observer list. In this case, plugins are more flexible.
 - Plugins are required when we need to change Magento core functionality (for example, adding more data to the order collection object). We can’t use Observer in this instance.

 Plugin vs Preference 
 - Preference is used for overriding class, Plugin is used for adding functionality before, after, and around methods.
 - You can use the preference from di.xml to override a public or protected method from a core class. plugin can't.

Magento 2 Virtual type
- Virtual types are a way of injecting dependencies into some of the existing classes without affecting other classes. 
- To explain this via a practical example, let's take a look at the following virtual type defined in the app/etc/di.xml file:
- Creating a virtual type is like creating a subclass of an existing class except for the fact that it's done in di.xml and not in code.
- Example. https://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/33103/what-is-the-difference-between-type-and-virtualtype 
- https://webkul.com/blog/virtual-types-in-magento-2/

Magento 2 Factories Vs Repository
- Factories are service classes that instantiate non-injectable classes, that is, models that represent a database entity. 
Magento’s object manager encounters a class name that ends in the word ‘Factory’, it will automatically generate the Factory class in the var/generation folder if the class does not already exist. You will see the factory class in
- Repository : A repository object is responsible for reading and writing your object information to an object store

Use Factories to create new entities Repositories do not come with methods to create a new entity, so in that case you will need a factory. 
But use the factory for the interface, such as Magento\Catalog\Api\Data\ProductInterfaceFactory - it will create the right implementation based on DI configuration.
Then use the repository->save() method to save it.
Repositories do not come with methods to create a new entity, so in that case, you will need a factory.

Magento 2 viewModel
- View model is class that we inject to phtml, so that require and related data could be access from it.
- View Model helps us to avoid unnecessary overriding of the block class

Differences Between MVC and MVVM 
The main differences between MVC and MVVM are, as follows: 

Separation of Concerns 
- MVC separates the application into three main components:
- Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application.  
- View: Handles the presentation layer and user interface.  
- Controller: Manages the interaction between the Model and the View.
- Data Binding : MVC typically does not have built-in data binding capabilities. The View relies on the Controller to retrieve data from the Model and update the UI manually.

- MVVM also emphasize separation of concerns, but with three different components:  
- Model: Represents the data and business logic, similar to MVC.  
- View: Handles the UI and presentation layer, akin to MVC.  
- ViewModel: Acts as an intermediary between the View and the Model, exposing data and commands for data binding. 
- Data Binding  : MVVM introduces powerful data binding capabilities. Data binding establishes a connection between the View and the ViewModel, allowing automatic synchronisation of data between them. When data changes in the ViewModel, the View is automatically updated, and user interactions trigger commands in the ViewModel.

EAV magento 2
- EAV stands for Entity, Attribute and Value.
- EAV is used because it is much more scalable than the usual normalised database structure. Developers can add attributes to any entity (product, category, customer, order etc) without modifying the core database structure. 

Entity: The entity represents Magento data items such as products, categories, customers and orders. Each entity (product, category, etc.) will have its own entity record in the database.
Attribute: The attributes represent data items that belong to an entity. For example, the product entity has attributes such as name, price, status and many more.
Value: The value is the simplest to understand as it is simply a value linked to an attribute. For better understanding, let’s consider the product entity. Each product entity will have a series of attributes, one of them is the name attribute. Each product will then have a value for the name attribute (and all other attributes).

Magento 2 Products 
1) Virtual products 
- A virtual product in Magento is a product type used to sell non-tangible products such as memberships, services, gift cards, and subscriptions.
- A virtual product in Magento is a product type used to sell non-tangible products such as memberships, services, gift cards, and subscriptions.
- The only difference between a simple and virtual product is that the Magento virtual product type doesn’t have any weight.
